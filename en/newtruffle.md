# NewTruffle

NewTruffle is a development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for NewChain, forked originally from truffle. With NewTruffle, you get:

*    Built-in smart contract compilation, linking, deployment and binary management.
*    Automated contract testing with Mocha and Chai.
*    Configurable build pipeline with support for custom build processes.
*    Scriptable deployment & migrations framework.
*    Network management for deploying to many public & private networks.
*    Interactive console for direct contract communication.
*    Instant rebuilding of assets during development.
*    External script runner that executes scripts within a Truffle environment.

## Install

```sh
$ npm install -g newtruffle
```

## Quick Usage

For a default set of contracts and tests, run the following within an empty project directory:

```sh
$ newtruffle init
```

From there, you can run ```newtruffle compile```, ```newtruffle migrate``` and ```newtruffle test``` to compile your contracts, deploy those contracts to the network, and run their associated unit tests.
